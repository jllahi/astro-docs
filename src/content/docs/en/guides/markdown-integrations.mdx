[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is commonly used to author text-heavy content like blog posts and documentation. Astro includes built-in support for standard Markdown files that can also include [frontmatter YAML](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/introduction-to-yaml-125f) to define custom metadata such as a title, description, and tags. Astro supports standard Markdown files out of the box, either as standalone pages or in content collections.

With the [@astrojs/mdx integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) installed, Astro also supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (`.mdx`) files which bring added features like support for JavaScript expressions and components in your Markdown content.

The [@astrojs/markdoc integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/) allows you to write your content collection entries in Markdoc (`.mdoc`) files. See the Markdoc integration guide for Markdoc usage in content collections.
